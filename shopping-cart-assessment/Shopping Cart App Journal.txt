Shopping Cart App

Notable 

Catalog class used a ArrayList of items to provide a selection for adding to cart.
ArrayList seemed easier to allow user to select items based on index.
Considering a way to make it an inventory which could be a HashMap.

Cart class has a method with logic to decide the print out items in cart.
Prints out with just the name from the item object in cart or
to print out items with name, price, and quanity formatted to read like a record of purchase / reciept.

This method is a sub-method in 2 CartService methods that reduces code duplication.

To remove an item when a String is entered that is compared to the key name (Item name<String>).
Removes if item exists in Map.
Two ways to do this.
	Using hashcode and the == operator.
	Using the .equals to compare the Strings directly.


Issue - Handling adding an item that already exists and negative quantity.

Thought of how to handle this and solution was the containsKey method.

When adding an item the logic checks for quantity greater than 0 and if same item exists in cart.
If same item exists a confirmation is asked to update the item with new quantity.
Item is updated with new quantity or left unchanged.
